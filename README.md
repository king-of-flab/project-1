### INSTRUCTIONS

Match the color sequence generated by the AI. For example, if the AI generates the color sequence green, blue, yellow and finally red, the buttons would highlight themselves in the respective order.

The player would then have to match the sequence in the exact same order by toggling the colored keys.



* The **green** button can be toggled by pressing the button "**G**".
* The **blue** button can be toggled by pressing the button "**H**".
* The **yellow** button can be toggled by pressing the button "**J**".
* The **red** button can be toggled by pressing the button "**K**".

If the player keys in the wrong sequence, the player would have lost and would need to start from level 1 again.

There are a total of seven levels.

# KEY FUNCTIONS

### generateRandomSequence()
The AI first generates a random array consisting of colors red, green, blue or yellow. The length of the array depends on the level. The higher the level, the higher the length of the array. Each level increases the array length by one. The first level starts with an array length of 4. Since there are a total of seven levels. The maximum array length is 10 (4 + 1 * 6).

```
function generateRandomSequence () {
for (i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  level.push(colors[getRandomIntInclusive()]);
}
```

### changeColorRed()

Highlights the color of the button when called. Helps to show the user which button has been pressed. To aid the user in identifying the highlighted color, a slight "beep" sound is also played when the button is highlighted.

Similar logic was used for the three other colors.

```
function changeColorRed () {
  redKey.style.backgroundColor = 'darkred';
  redSound.play();
  setTimeout(reutrnColorRed, 400);
  }
  ```

### Highlighting the buttons generated by the AI

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (level[i-1] === 'red') {
    setTimeout(changeColorRed, i * 1000);
  } else if (level[i-1] === 'green') {
    setTimeout(changeColorGreen, i * 1000);
  } else if (level[i-1] === 'blue') {
    setTimeout(changeColorBlue, i * 1000);
  } else if (level[i-1] === 'yellow') {
    setTimeout(changeColorYellow, i * 1000);
  }
}
```

### checkEqual()

Checks if each color entered by the user matches the sequence churned out by the AI.

"**keyedColors**" represent the colors keyed by the user.
"**level**" represents the color sequence churned out by the AI.



```
function checkEqual () {
  if (keyedColors.length !== level.length) {
    return false;
  }
  for (i = 0; i < keyedColors.length; i++) {
    if (keyedColors[i] !== level[i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
  }
  ```
